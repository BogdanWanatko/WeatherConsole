Console Weather Application
This is a simple console application that retrieves weather information from the Open-Meteo API. The application prompts the user to enter a latitude and longitude, and then it displays the current weather conditions and the temperature for the next 7 days.

Requirements
.NET Framework 4.7 or higher

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the solution in Visual Studio
Build the solution
Run the application

Customization
You can customize the application by changing the values of the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE variables in the Program.cs file.

Notes
The Open-Meteo API only provides weather information for the next 7 days, so it may not be suitable for long-term forecasting.
The API requires an API key, which is not included in this application. To use the API, you need to sign up for an account on the Open-Meteo website and obtain an API key.
